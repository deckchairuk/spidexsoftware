				<h2>Situation</h2>

				<p>In an audit carried out by a major retail customer, Huntapac was criticised for its manually-recorded preventative maintenance regime and for its management of engineering spare parts.</p>

				<h2>Implementation</h2>

				<p>Huntapac selected Mainsaver CMMS to support improved practices in its management of plant maintenance.</p>

				<p>Following installation of Mainsaver, the implementation team first created a database of the company’s machinery assets and assigned new preventative maintenance schedules against each one. They also logged the entire spare parts inventory to keep track of on-hand quantities and associated costs.</p>

				<p>The system was then made available to engineers and production staff by loading Mainsaver onto touchscreen PCs housed in stainless steel kiosks in the engineering workshop and out in the production area. Any member of staff was thereby able to report engineering faults and even suggest modifications to production equipment.</p>

				<p>Although the initial purpose of the project was to demonstrate better management of PMs and spare parts to auditors, the fault-reporting and subsequent root-cause analysis meant that Huntapac practically eliminated instances of large-scale production stoppage which had been a regular occurrence previously.</p>

					<p>On its next audit, the same supermarket customer whose criticism initiated the improvement project now cited Huntapac as an example of best practice and profiled the company on its supplier website.</p>

					<p>The reduction in lost production time m3eant the Mainsaver CMMS implementation completely paid for itself inside 6 months.</p>
